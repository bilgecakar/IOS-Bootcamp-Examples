## Our Goal
The goal of this challenge is to review some of the concepts learnt in the previous modules. Especially relating to the creation of multi-screen apps through the use of segues.

## What I will create
By the end of the module, I have made beautiful bill splitting, tip calculating app. No one can work out $145.56 split between 5 people with a 20 percent tip. With my very own Tipsy app in hand, Youâ€™ll never need to do maths ever again!
