## Boss Challenge
One of the most important skills as a developer is looking up how to do something you've never done before. Follow the 5 step process you learnt in the Xylophone module and use Google search, StackOverflow and Apple Documentation to complete the challenge make your app do what you want it to!

- [x] Figure out how to use code to change the opacity of the button that was pressed so that when you press a button on the Xylophone app, it will dim to half the original opacity.

- [x] Next, figure out how to delay code execution by 0.2 seconds, so that when you press on one of the Xylophone buttons your code immediately print “Start” and then prints “End” after 0.2 seconds.

- [x] Finally, put it all together to achieve a goal. The goal is to dim the button that was pressed by 0.2 seconds and then make it go back to its original opacity to achieve the effect of an animated button press.
